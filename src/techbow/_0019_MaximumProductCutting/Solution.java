 *
 * Given a rope of length n meters, cut the rope in different parts of integer
 * lengths in a way that maximizes product of lengths of all parts. You must
 * make at least one cut. Assume that the length of rope is more than 2 meters.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: n = 2
 *
 * Output: 1 (Maximum obtainable product is 1*1)
 *
 * Input: n = 3
 *
 * Output: 2 (Maximum obtainable product is 1*2)
 *
 * Input: n = 4
 *
 * Output: 4 (Maximum obtainable product is 2*2)
 *
 * Input: n = 5
 *
 * Output: 6 (Maximum obtainable product is 2*3)
 *
 * Input: n = 10
 *
 * Output: 36 (Maximum obtainable product is 3*3*4)
