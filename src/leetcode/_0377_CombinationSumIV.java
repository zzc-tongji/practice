/*
 * 0377. Combination Sum IV
 *
 * Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the
 * number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * nums = [1, 2, 3]
 *
 * target = 4
 *
 * The possible combination ways are:
 *
 * (1, 1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 2) (1, 2, 1) (1, 3) (2, 1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 1)
 *
 * Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
 *
 * Therefore the output is 7.
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * - What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? - How does it
 * change the problem? - What limitation we need to add to the question to allow
 * negative numbers?
 *
 * Credits:
 *
 * Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test
 * cases.
